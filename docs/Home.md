# iTrust2: Role-Based Healthcare

iTrust2 was founded as a class project for [CSC326 Software Engineering](http://courses.ncsu.edu/csc326) in the [Computer Science Department of NC State University](http://www.csc.ncsu.edu) and is maintained by the Software Engineering Faculty and their students. The goal of iTrust2 is to engage students with software engineering practices on a significant, relevant, and growing application that includes security and privacy requirements.  

iTrust2 is an electronics health records system (EHR) that provides patients with a means to maintain their health records and communicate with their health care providers (HCPs).  HCPs can record information about office visits including basic health metrics, diagnoses, and prescriptions. iTrust2 follows [HIPAA statue](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/hipaa/) for ensuring security and privacy of patient records.
