# UC19 Food Diary

## 19.1 Preconditions

The iTrust2 user has authenticated themselves in iTrust2 ([UC2](https://github.ncsu.edu/engr-csc326-staff/iTrust2-v1/wiki/uc2)) as a patient or HCP.

## 19.2 Main Flow

Any patient may select to either view their food diary or add a new diary entry.  If the patient selects to view their food diary, every diary entry is displayed with the information contained in [S1] with the most recent entries (by date of the entry in the food diary) being displayed first and calculates totals with [S2][E1]. If patient selects to add a new diary entry, they enter the required information into the form [S1]. The patient submits the form [E2] and is sent to the page to view their food diary. 

Any HCP may view food diary entries (but may not create them) for a patient in the iTrust2 system.  The HCP may search for patients, and upon selecting one, will see a food diary displayed exactly as the patient would [S2][E1].

## 19.3 Subflows
