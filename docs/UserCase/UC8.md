# UC8 Basic Health Metrics

## 8.1 Preconditions
An HCP is a registered user of the iTrust2 Medical Records system ([UC1](uc1)).  The HCP has authenticated themselves in the iTrust2 Medical Records system ([UC2](uc2)).  The HCP has started documenting an office visit for the patient ([UC7](uc7)).

## 8.2 Main Flow
The HCP enters health metrics appropriate for the age of the patient: under 3 years [S1], between 3 years and under 12 years [S2], and 12 and over [S3]. All ages are calculated as calendar years between the date of the office visit and the patientâ€™s birthdate.  The HCP can edit the basic health metrics.  For creating or editing an office visit, the HCP enters the appropriate information and submits.  A success message is displayed and the HCP sees the saved information.

The patient can view the basic health metrics recorded for an office visit.
