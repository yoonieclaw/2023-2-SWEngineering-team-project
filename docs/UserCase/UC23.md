# UC23 Laboratory Test Results Management

## 23.1 Preconditions
The iTrust2 user has authenticated themselves in iTrust2 as a patient, HCP (General Healthcare Provider, Optometrist Healthcare Provider, or Ophthalmologist Healthcare Provider), Lab Tech,or Administrator. Relevant patients, HCPs, and Lab Techs are registered in the iTrust2 system.

## 23.2 Main Flow
A General Healthcare Provider, Optometrist Healthcare Provider, or Ophthalmologist Healthcare Provider can order laboratory tests for a patient [S1]. The Lab Tech can process the laboratory tests and record the results in the system [S2]. The patient, Lab Tech, and the ordering HCP can view the laboratory test results [S3]. 

## 23.3 Sub-flows
* [S1]: HCP selects a patient and orders laboratory tests by specifying the tests needed, the lab where they should be processed, and any special instructions. A notification is sent to the Lab Tech and the patient.
* [S2]: Lab Tech processes the laboratory tests and records the results in the system, including any notes or observations.
* [S3]: Patient, Lab Tech, or HCP logs into the system and navigates to the ‘Laboratory Test Results’ section to view all laboratory test results along with details of each test.

## 23.4 Alternate Flows
* [E1]: If any required information is missing or incorrect while ordering tests or recording results, an error message is shown to the HCP or Lab Tech.
