# UC13 View Access Logs

## 13.1 Preconditions

A user is a registered user of the iTrust2 Medical Records system (UC1). The user has authenticated himself or herself in the iTrust2 Medical Records system (UC2).

## 13.2 Main Flow:

The user logs into iTrust2 and is greeted with the top entries in his or her access log [S1].  The user can choose to view his or her access log [S2] on a separate page.  The user can then choose the beginning and end date for the period of time they would like to view their access log for [S3]. The resulting list should include the following for each access:

   * Name of accessor
   * Role of accessor relative to the patient (if the logged event is for a patient)
   * Date and time of access
   * [Transaction Type](https://github.ncsu.edu/engr-csc326-staff/iTrust2-v2/blob/master/iTrust2/src/main/java/edu/ncsu/csc/itrust2/models/enums/TransactionType.java)

## 13.3 Sub-flows:

   * [S1] When the user logs in, their landing screen displays the ten most recent events.
   * [S2] By default, upon browsing to the new page, the user is presented with a list of all entries sorted by dates, most recent access first.
   * [S3] The user may enter a date range to view all entries within the range.

## 13.4 Alternative Flows:
   * [E1] The user enters an invalid date, or enters an end date that is before the start date.  No events are shown and the user has the opportunity to select different dates.
